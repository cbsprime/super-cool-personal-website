<p><b>MIS 4720: Systems Analysis and Design</b></p>
<p>The focus of this course is the design and development of computer-based information systems to support business needs. The course examines all aspects of this task, starting with the identification of a business need, analysis of the processes to be supported by the new system, and the specification of business requirements using various techniques. Using tools such as data flow and ER diagrams, students learn how to model a system. These concepts are put into practice as students design and build a system to support a business need (as described in a case study). Part of the development process is to consider the required infrastructure, and to plan the implementation process. </p>

<p><b>Project Description:</b></p>	
<p>	The current system at Southwestern Tires relied heavily on paperwork, an incredibly outdated computer system, and employees counting inventory. </p>
<p>We were handed the planning and analysis done by a different group. During this process, my team and I learned how to prepare deliverables that are high quality inputs for others how to communicate with out group members and with other groups who are part of our team.</p>
<p>We used the tools and techniques of the structured design methodology to model information systems requirements, applied these tools and techniques to a business problem, and communicated the progress and the results of systems analysis and design process to create a relational database allowing users to update inventory files quickly and easily at the time of a sale and incoming shipment, record tire sales including store/salesman/date/tire code, and check the inventory of all stores to determine which tries to reorder.</p>
